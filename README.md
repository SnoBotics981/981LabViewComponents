Control Spread Sheet Notes
--------------------------
For reading and writing files to the roboRIO the Control System Hardware document (2017 version)
on pages 101-102 recommend using FileZilla. The link:

https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client

I'd recommend we have this installed on all of our computers that might interact with our robots.

The vi 'ReadCvsControlSpreadsheet' reads the ControlSpreadsheet, which is stored as a comma separated spreadsheet.

The tables have been updated for the 2018 version of the software – but ‘should’ be compatible with older versions of the software.
